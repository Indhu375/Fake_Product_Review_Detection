📌 Fake Review Detection using Machine Learning

This project detects fake vs genuine product reviews using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The dataset contains Amazon product reviews labeled as fake or genuine, along with ratings and product categories.

✅ Project Overview

Fake customer reviews can mislead buyers and damage product trust.
This project builds a text classification model that takes a review as input and predicts whether the review is fake or real.

The approach involves:

Cleaning and preprocessing review text

Converting text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF

Training a Logistic Regression classification model

Evaluating model performance
